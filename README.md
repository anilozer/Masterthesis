# Masterthesis

This repository includes the code and notebooks created or used for my Master thesis. 

diversity_metrics.py, rbo.py and word_embeddings_rbo.py codes are from https://github.com/silviatti/topic-model-diversity. These topic diversity metrics were used to evaluate two different algorithms: LDA and BERTopic. 

In line with Terragni et al.(2021)'s recommendation, I created a BERT word_embeddings_rbo test to measure diversity with BERT word embeddings, instead of fastTextcc that Terragni uses.
